# NaturalCC - Natural Code Comprehension

</div>

## üìñ Vision

NaturalCC is a sequence modeling toolkit designed to bridge the gap between programming and natural languages through advanced machine learning techniques. It allows researchers and developers to train custom models for a variety of software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation, code completion, code summarization, code retrieval, code clone detection, and type inference.


## üåü Key Features:

- **Modular and Extensible Framework:** Built on the robust Fairseq's registry mechanism, allowing for easy adaptation and extension to diverse software engineering tasks.
- **Datasets and Preprocessing Tools+:** Offers access to a variety of clean, preprocessed benchmarks such as Human-Eval, CodeSearchNet, Python-Doc, and Py150. Comes equipped with scripts for feature extraction using compiler tools like LLVM.
- **Support for Large Code Models:** Incorporates state-of-the-art large code models like Code Llama, CodeT5, CodeGen, and StarCoder.
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: Benchmarks multiple downstream tasks (including code generation and code completion), with evaluation capabilities on well-known benchmarks using popular metrics like pass@k.
- **Optimized for Efficiency:** Employs the `NCCL` library and `torch.distributed` for high-efficiency model training across multiple GPUs. Supports both full-precision (`FP32`) and half-precision (`FP16`) computations to accelerate training and inference processes.
- **Enhanced Logging for Improved Debugging:** Advanced logging features to provide clear, detailed feedback during model training and operation, aiding in debugging and performance optimization.

- **[May 10, 2022]** Merged the source code of "What Do They Capture? - A Structural Analysis of Pre-Trained Language Models for Source Code" into NaturalCC.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

To get started with NaturalCC, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- GCC/G++ version 5.0 or higher
- NVIDIA GPU, NCCL, and the Cuda Toolkit for training new models (optional but recommended)
- NVIDIA's apex library for faster training (optional)

Follow these steps to set up the environment.

1. (Optional) Creating conda environment
    ```shell
    conda create -n naturalcc python=3.6
    conda activate naturalcc
    ```

2. Building NaturalCC from source
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/CGCL-codes/naturalcc && cd naturalcc
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install --editable ./
    ```
3. Installing Additional Dependencies
    ```shell
    pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
    pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate.git
    ```

4. HuggingFace Token for Certain Models

    For models like [StarCoder](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder), a HuggingFace token is required. Log in to HuggingFace using:
    ```
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Example 1: Code Generation

1. Download the model checkpoint

    First, download the checkpoint of a specific large code model. For this example, we use [Codellama-7B](https://huggingface.co/camenduru/CodeLlama-7b).


2. Prepare the testing dataset

    Create a JSON file containing your test cases in the following format:

    ```json
    [
    ¬† {"input": "this is a"},
    ¬† {"input": "from tqdm import"},
    ¬† {"input": "def calculate("},
    ¬† {"input": "a = b**2"},
    ¬† {"input": "torch.randint"},
    ¬† {"input": "x = [1,2"}
    ]
    ```

3. Running the code generation scripts

    1. Initialize the task with the specific model and GPU device:

        ```python
        print('Initializing GenerationTask')
        task = GenerationTask(task_name="codellama_7b_code", device="cuda:0")
        ```

    2. Load the downloaded checkpoint into the task. Replace `ckpt_path` with the path to your downloaded checkpoint:

        ```python
        print('Loading model weights [{}]'.format(ckpt_path))
        task.from_pretrained(ckpt_path)
        ```

    3. Load your dataset. Replace `dataset_path` with the path to your dataset file:

        ```python
        print('Processing dataset [{}]'.format(dataset_path))
        task.load_dataset(dataset_path)
        ```

    4. Run the model and output the results. Replace `output_path` with your desired output file path:

        ```python
        task.run(output_path=output_path, batch_size=1, max_length=50)
        print('Output file: {}'.format(output_path))
        ```

### Example 2: Code Summarization

1. Download and process a dataset from ```datasets```, and follow the instructions from the README.md file.
    ```shell
    # ref: dataset/python_wan/README.md
    # download dataset
    bash dataset/python_wan/download.sh
    # clean data
    python -m dataset.python_wan.clean
    # cast data attributes into different files
    python -m dataset.python_wan.attributes_cast

    # ref: dataset/python_wan/summarization/README.md
    # save code tokens and docstirng tokens into MMAP format
    python -m dataset.python_wan.summarization.preprocess
    ```

2. Register your self-defined models
    - If you want to create a new model, please add your model at ```ncc/models``` and ```ncc/modules```.

    - If your training policy are more complex than we thought, you should update your criterions and training procedure at ```ncc/criterions``` and ```ncc/trainers```, respectively.
      <br>

      Do not forget to update your self defined module at ```ncc/XX/__init__.py```.

3. Training and inference.
    - Select a task and a model from [task list](run/) and follow the instructions in its README.md to start your learning.
    ```shell
    # ref: run/summarization/transformer/README.md
    # train
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 nohup python -m run.summarization.transformer.train -f config/python_wan/python > run/summarization/transformer/config/python_wan/python.log 2>&1 &
    # inference
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m run.summarization.transformer.eval -f config/python_wan/python -o run/summarization/transformer/config/python_wan/python.txt
    ```
