# Release Notes

- 2.1.0 (TBD)
  Features:
  - Added `-tok spm` for multilingual SPM tokenization
    (thanks to Naman Goyal and James Cross at Facebook)

  Fixes:
  - Handle potential memory usage issues due to LRU caching in tokenizers (#167)
  - Bugfix: BLEU.corpus_score() now using max_ngram_order (#173)

- 2.0.0 (2021-07-18)
  - Build: Add Windows and OS X testing to Travis CI.
  - Improve documentation and type annotations.
  - Drop `Python < 3.6` support and migrate to f-strings.
  - Relax `portalocker` version pinning, add `regex, tabulate, numpy` dependencies.
  - Drop input type manipulation through `isinstance` checks. If the user does not obey
    to the expected annotations, exceptions will be raised. Robustness attempts lead to
    confusions and obfuscated score errors in the past (#121)
  - Variable # references per segment is supported for all metrics by default. It is
    still only available through the API.
  - Use colored strings in tabular outputs (multi-system evaluation mode) through
    the help of `colorama` package.
  - tokenizers: Add caching to tokenizers which seem to speed up things a bit.
  - `intl` tokenizer: Use `regex` module. Speed goes from ~4 seconds to ~0.6 seconds
    for a particular test set evaluation. (#46)
  - Signature: Formatting changed (mostly to remove '+' separator as it was
    interfering with chrF++). The field separator is now '|' and key values
    are separated with ':' rather than '.'.
  - Signature: Boolean true / false values are shortened to yes / no.
  - Signature: Number of references is `var` if variable number of references is used.
  - Signature: Add effective order (yes/no) to BLEU and chrF signatures.
  - Metrics: Scale all metrics into the [0, 100] range (#140)
  - Metrics API: Use explicit argument names and defaults for the metrics instead of
    passing obscure `argparse.Namespace` objects.
  - Metrics API: A base abstract `Metric` class is introduced to guide further
    metric development. This class defines the methods that should be implemented
    in the derived classes and offers boilerplate methods for the common functionality.
    A new metric implemented this way will automatically support significance testing.
  - Metrics API: All metrics now receive an optional `references` argument at
    initialization time to process and cache the references. Further evaluations
    of different systems against the same references becomes faster this way
    for example when using significance testing.
  - BLEU: In case of no n-gram matches at all, skip smoothing and return 0.0 BLEU (#141).
  - CHRF: Added multi-reference support, verified the scores against chrF++.py, added test case.
  - CHRF: Added chrF+ support through `word_order` argument. Added test cases against chrF++.py.
    Exposed it through the CLI (--chrf-word-order) (#124)
  - CHRF: Add possibility to disable effective order smoothing (pass --chrf-eps-smoothing).
    This way, the scores obtained are exactly the same as chrF++, Moses and NLTK implementations.
    We keep the effective ordering as the default for compatibility, since this only
    affects sentence-level scoring with very short sentences. (#144)
  - CLI: `--input/-i` can now ingest multiple systems. For this reason, the positional
    `references` should always preceed the `-i` flag.
  - CLI: Allow modifying TER arguments through CLI. We still keep the TERCOM defaults.
  - CLI: Prefix metric-specific arguments with --chrf and --ter. To maintain compatibility,
    BLEU argument names are kept the same.
  - CLI: Separate metric-specific arguments for clarity when `--help` is printed.
  - CLI: Added `--format/-f` flag. The single-system output mode is now `json` by default.
    If you want to keep the old text format persistently, you can export `SACREBLEU_FORMAT=text` into your
    shell.
  - CLI: For multi-system mode, `json` falls back to plain text. `latex` output can only
    be generated for multi-system mode.
  - CLI: sacreBLEU now supports evaluating multiple systems for a given test set
    in an efficient way. Through the use of `tabulate` package, the results are
    nicely rendered into a plain text table, LaTeX, HTML or RST (cf. --format/-f argument).
    The systems can be either given as a list of plain text files to `-i/--input` or
    as a tab-separated single stream redirected into `STDIN`. In the former case,
    the basenames of the files will be automatically used as system names.
  - Statistical tests: sacreBLEU now supports confidence interval estimation
    through bootstrap resampling for single-system evaluation (`--confidence` flag)
    as well as paired bootstrap resampling (`--paired-bs`) and paired approximate
    randomization tests (`--paired-ar`) when evaluating multiple systems (#40 and #78).

- 1.5.1 (2021-03-05)
  - Fix extraction error for WMT18 extra test sets (test-ts) (#142)

  - Pin Mecab version to 1.0.3 for Python 3.5 support
  - [API Change]: Default value for `floor` smoothing is now 0.1 instead of 0.
  - [API Change]: `sacrebleu.sentence_bleu()` now uses the `exp` smoothing method,
    exactly the same as the CLI's --sentence-level behavior. This was mainly done
    to make two methods behave the same.
  - Add smoothing value to BLEU signature (#98)

   - Added a simple (non-atomic) lock on downloading
   - Can now read multiple refs from a single tab-delimited file.
     You need to pass `--num-refs N` to tell it to run the split.
     Only works with a single reference file passed from the command line.

     - 'smooth' is now 'smooth_method'
     - 'smooth_floor' is now 'smooth_value'
